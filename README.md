We will use this to explain the project. It needs to contain

Note: this is only a basic documentation as the project is not finished yet. All the explanations will be better develop at the end.

Use: The code aims to simulate the process of Deep Water Convection based on the example code from Oceananigans. 

How to run the model?
1-Constants.jl: Set the parameters of the simulation (ex: wind speed of 5 m/s), with the other parameters setted as defauld
2-Run "model_loop.jl". This will create a file with the simulation, considering the constants that were setted
