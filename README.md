We will use this to explain the project. It needs to contain

Note: this is only a basic documentation as the project is not finished yet. All the explanations will be better develop at the end.

Use: The code aims to simulate the process of Deep Water Convection based on the example code from Oceananigans. 

How to run the model?
1-Run the "model definition" file, wit will create a .jld2 file that has all the conditions required to run the model (boundary, forcing and initial conditions).

2-Run the "model simulation". This will make the loop, according to the previous conditions. The output will be a .jld2 file but now with all the data.
